# O1.1 Deterministic Stability and Gait Report

**Classification: `REACHABILITY_ONLY`**

- Checkpoint: `/home/linkerhand/IsaacLab/logs/skrl/dex5_penspin_privileged_oracle/2026-07-30_22-46-01_ppo_torch_o1_5_baseline_P3Only_budget60/checkpoints/agent_1440.pt`
- Environments / steps: `256 / 240`
- Ballistic termination guard: `False`
- Completed episodes: `550`
- Raw gait / qualified gait: `13.45% / 0.00%`
- Support handoff success: `0.00%`
- Raw 180 deg / qualified 180 deg: `99.82% / 0.00%`
- Failure / contact loss / ballistic: `85.27% / 2.00% / 0.00%`
- Mean ballistic exposure: `0.00` control steps per completed episode

Qualified means: directional axis alignment >= 0.70, no ballistic, no contact-loss termination, and no failure.

## Thumb And Height Recovery

A thumb attempt is any post-release raw thumb contact that has not yet passed the three-step re-contact debounce. Height recovery requires a prior >=5 mm drop followed by return to within 2 mm of reset height.

| Canonical | Thumb release | Attempt | Re-contact | Mean break step | Mean attempt step | Height drop | Height recovery | Min height delta |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| P1 | 0.00% | 0.00% | 0.00% | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.00% | 0.00% | 0.00 mm |
| P2 | 0.00% | 0.00% | 0.00% | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.00% | 0.00% | 0.00 mm |
| P3 | 100.00% | 7.27% | 0.36% | 3.0 | 56.4 | 99.45% | 0.00% | -38.62 mm |

## Debounced Finger Events

Each break and re-contact must remain stable for at least 3 control steps. Re-contact is counted as gait only after a prior break in the same episode.
